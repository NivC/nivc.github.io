I research methods to detect and understand unexpected phenomena in the behavior of machine learning models as well as in scientific data.

I am now a post-doc at [New York University](https://engineering.nyu.edu/), working with Prof. [Chinmay Hegde](https://chinmayhegde.github.io/).
Prior to that I received my PhD at the [Hebrew University](https://www.vision.huji.ac.il/main/), supervised by Prof. [Yedid Hoshen](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~ydidh).

You can also check my personal [site](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/w~nivc/riddles.html) with some nice riddles and more.
